This directory contains FreeRTOS V11.2.0 released March 04, 2025.

To reduce the size, the portable sub-directory has been pruned and
several FreeRTOS ports have been removed. Additionally, the files
in the FreeRTOS distribution have been cleaned up with the 'qclean'
host utility to remove traling whitespace, force the LF end-of-line
convention, replace tabs with spaces, etc.

To get the complete FreeRTOS release, please refer to the original
on GitHub:
